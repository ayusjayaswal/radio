* Just a Radio, nothing more nothing less
Stop panicking about what music to listen... Just tune in to a random Radio Station.
** TODOS:
	+ create a minimal gui frontend
	+ create a repo of well known radio stations
** Dependencies 
+ +ffmpeg (for ffplay) : Most Probably already installed in your system.+
          switched to libmpv to save my sanity...
+ libmpv
** Installation
Build from source...
#+begin_src sh
	git clone --depth=1 "https://github.com/ayusjayaswal/radio"
	cd radio
	g++ main.cpp -o radio -lmpv
	sudo mv radio /usr/local/bin/
#+end_src
** Usage
*** Configuration
As of now, only configuration you can do is to set the radio stations and their links in =$HOME/.config/radio/config.ini=
*** Use Flags
/Running without any flag plays a random Radio station/
Options:
  -l                 List all available stations
  -v                 Verbose Listing of Radio Stations along with desciptions
  -s <station_name>  Play the specified station
  -h                 Display this help message

*** To run interactively from Unix terminal 
#+begin_src sh
radio -l | fzf | echo "\"$(awk '{$1=""; print substr($0,2)}')\"" | xargs -r radio -s
#+end_src
